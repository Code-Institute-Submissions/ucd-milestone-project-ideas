BOP HEAVEN 


Website can be found here:

## Website Description ##

The website is my dedication to the Jazz music style of the late l940’s called BOP.Many great recordings were made over the last 60 years and I want to shine a light on more of the many unknown musicians of the past and present.I want to give the listener,musician,fan,record collector etc a one stop shop for video’s,recordings,books and to discover artists from all periods of the bop music.

## Who’s this website for? ##

This website is for newcomers and seasoned fans of the music genre.The art form has been around for 100 plus years.The trailblazers of the music have all passed on but the legacy they have left is astounding.I am hoping that visitors to the site will see an artist and go on to discover more about them.Music downloads,cds are readily available from my retailers on the internet.I have been a jazz fan for 25 years.

The heyday of bop started in the late 40’s then moved into the hardbop style of the 50’s. Then throughout the 60’s the music came to be known as postbop/modern jazz.And in the late 60’s the great trumpeter Miles Davis stated.I quote “ Jazz is dead.The music of the museum”.The style became a fad to him and a lot of musicians stopped playing bop.

Musicians of the bop era went looking for new sounds,new avenues for expression during the late 60’s and all the way through to the early 80’s.In the late 80’s a resurgence began in the music.Bop or straight ahead musicians started to emerge and began recording with various labels.Those jazz labels are included under the record/labels tab.
This style is still being played today so as long they’re musicians out there who dedicate themselves to the art.Bop will never become the music of the museum.
Enjoy!!

## Website Function ##

I have included tabs for magazines,books,recordings,artist-biography and videos with a focus on the lesser known musicians.There’s a lot to discover here with new artists emerging.As the website begins to grow I will include more content regarding new and those lesser known artists who I think deserve wider recognition.You cannot have a website dedicated to bop without the heavy hitters.Monk,Coltrane,Miles and Blakey all have their place in the BOP hall of fame on every page of the site.
